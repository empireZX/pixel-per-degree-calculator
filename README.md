# Viewing Distance Adjustment Adviser

This Python program aims to assist users in calculating the pixels per degree based on their screen size and current viewing distance and provides recommendations for adjusting the viewing distance for optimal visual experience.

## Features

- Computes pixels per degree based on given screen parameters and viewing distance.
- Provides specific recommendations to increase or decrease the viewing distance based on the target pixels per degree (defaulted to 60 pixels per degree).

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed in your environment.
2. Download `calculate_adjustment.py` (assuming the code is saved in this file).
3. In the terminal or command prompt, run the following command:

```bash
python calculate_adjustment.py
```

4. Follow the prompts of the program and input the screen width (in pixels), height (in pixels), diagonal size (in meters), and current viewing distance (in meters).

## Input Example

[Provide an example of input if needed]

## Output

The program will calculate the current pixels per degree and provide recommendations for adjusting the viewing distance based on this value.

## Development Environment

- Python 3.8 or higher

## Dependencies

No specific dependencies. The program utilizes the `math` module from the Python standard library.
